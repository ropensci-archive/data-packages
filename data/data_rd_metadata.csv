Note that geo.sets may even contain nested geo.sets. Note: even a single geographic unit --- one specific tract or county --- must be wrapped up as a geo.set.  Technically, each individual element in the set is known as a ""geo"", but users will rarely (if ever) interact will individual elements such as this; wrapping all groups of geographies --- even groups consisting of just one element --- in geo.sets like this will help make them easier to deal with as the geographies get more complex. geo.set objects may be combined with the simple addition operator ( list(""+"") ).  By default, this will always return ""flat"" geo.sets with all the geographies in a single list.  The combination operator list(""c"") ), on the other hand, will generally return nested hierarchies, embedding sets within sets.  When working with nested sets like this, the ""combine"" flag can be set at each level to aggregate subsets within the structure (although be careful --- if a higher level of set includes ""combine=T"" you'll never actually see the unaggregated subsets deeper down). Using these different techniques, users are able to create whatever sort of new geographies they need --- aggregating some geographies, keeping others distinct (but still bundled as a set for convenience), mixing and matching different levels of Census geography, and so on.","NA","NA",http://eglenn.scripts.mit.edu/citystate/category/code/,TRUE,TRUE

ADDT,ADDT-package,Accelerated Destructive Degradation Testing,"Accelerated destructive degradation tests (ADDT) are often used to collect necessary data for assessing the long-term properties of polymeric materials. Based on the collected data, a thermal index (TI) is estimated. The TI can be useful for material rating and comparisons. This package implements the traditional method based on the least-squares method, the parametric method based on maximum likelihood estimation, and the semiparametric method based on spline methods, and their corresponding methods for estimating TI for polymeric materials. The traditional approach is a two-step approach that is currently used in industrial standards, while the parametric method is widely used in the statistical literature. The semiparametric method is newly developed. The parametric and semiparametric approaches allow one to do statistical inference such as quantifying uncertainties in estimation, hypothesis testing, and predictions. Publicly available datasets are provided for illustrations. More details can be found in Jin et al. (2017).","NA","NA","C. B. King, Y. Xie, Y. Hong, J. H. Van Mullekom, S. P. DeHart, and P. A.

AICcmodavg,AICcmodavg-package,Model Selection and Multimodel Inference Based on (Q)AIC(c),"Description:  This package includes functions to create model selection tables based on Akaike's information criterion (AIC) and the second-order AIC (AICc), as well as their quasi-likelihood counterparts (QAIC, QAICc).  The package also features functions to conduct classic model averaging (multimodel inference) for a given parameter of interest or predicted values, as well as a shrinkage version of model averaging parameter estimates.  Other handy functions enable the computation of relative variable importance, evidence ratios, and confidence sets for the best model.  The present version works with Cox proportional hazards models and conditional logistic regression ( list(""coxph"") and list(""coxme"") classes), linear models ( list(""lm"") class), generalized linear models ( list(""glm"") , list(""vglm"") list(""hurdle"") , and list(""zeroinfl"") classes), linear models fit by generalized least squares ( list(""gls"") class), linear mixed models ( list(""lme"") linear mixed models ( list(""mer"") list(""merMod"") classes), multinomial and ordinal logistic regressions ( list(""multinom"") list(""polr"") list(""clm"") list(""clmm"") classes), robust regression models list(""rlm"") class), beta regression models ( list(""betareg"") class), parametric survival models ( list(""survreg"") class), nonlinear models list(""nls"") list(""gnls"") classes), nonlinear mixed models list(""nlme"") list(""nlmerMod"") classes), univariate models list(""fitdist"") list(""fitdistr"") classes), and certain types of latent variable models ( list(""lavaan"") class).  The package also supports various models of list(""unmarkedFit"") list(""maxLikeFit"") classes estimating demographic parameters after accounting for imperfect detection probabilities.  Some functions also allow the creation of model selection tables for Bayesian models of the list(""bugs"") list(""rjags"") classes.

Raw material in this process is put through a sequence of 27 steps to generate the final pharmaceutical product.  The starting material is generated from a biological unit and has a range of quality and characteristics.  The objective in this project was to develop a model to predict percent yield of the manufacturing process.  The data set consisted of 177 samples of biological material for which 57 characteristics were measured.  Of the 57 characteristics, there were 12 measurements of the biological starting material, and 45 measurements of the manufacturing process.  The process variables included measurements such as temperature, drying time, washing time, and concentrations of by--products at various steps.  Some of the process measurements can be controlled, while others are observed.  Predictors are continuous, count, categorical; some are correlated, and some contain missing values.

This data set consisted of 281 unique compounds; 376 predictors were measured or computed for each. The response was categorical (either ""None"", ""Mild"" or ""Severe"" ),and was highly unbalanced. This kind of response often occurs in pharmaceutical data because companies steer away from creating molecules that have undesirable characteristics. Therefore, well-behaved molecules often greatly outnumber undesirable molecules. The predictors consisted of measurements from 184 biological screens and 192 chemical feature predictors. The biological predictors represent activity for each screen and take values between 0 and 10 with a mode of 4. The chemical feature predictors represent counts of important sub-structures as well as measures of physical properties that are thought to be associated with hepatic injury.","NA","NA","NA",TRUE,FALSE

AppliedPredictiveModeling,permeability,Permeability Data,"This pharmaceutical data set was used to develop a model for predicting compounds' permeability.  In short, permeability is the measure of a molecule's ability to cross a membrane.  The body, for example, has notable membranes between the body and brain, known as the blood-brain barrier, and between the gut and body in the intestines.  These membranes help the body guard critical regions from receiving undesirable or detrimental substances.  For an orally taken drug to be effective in the brain, it first must pass through the intestinal wall and then must pass through the blood-brain barrier in order to be present for the desired neurological target.  Therefore, a compound's ability to permeate relevant biological membranes is critically important to understand early in the drug discovery process.  Compounds that appear to be effective for a particular disease in research screening experiments, but appear to be poorly permeable may need to be altered in order improve permeability, and thus the compound's ability to reach the desired target.  Identifying permeability problems can help guide chemists towards better molecules. Permeability assays such as PAMPA and Caco-2 have been developed to help measure compounds' permeability (Kansy et al, 1998).  These screens are effective at quantifying a compound's permeability, but the assay is expensive labor intensive.  Given a sufficient number of compounds that have been screened, we could develop a predictive model for permeability in an attempt to potentially reduce the need for the assay.  In this project there were 165 unique compounds; 1107 molecular fingerprints were determined for each.  A molecular fingerprint is a binary sequence of numbers that represents the presence or absence of a specific molecular sub-structure.  The response is highly skewed, the predictors are sparse (15.5 percent are present), and many predictors are strongly associated.","NA","Kansy, M., Senner, F., and Gubernator, K. (1998).

This parameterization allows for hypotheses on the location of an active region, the spatial extent of an active region, and the amplitude of an active region. ARF can be invoked after standard GLM analysis, and uses the beta-values or t-values from this analysis. In addition ARF can be used to estimate functional connectivity, for this the raw time-series (on which the GLM was performed) are also needed. The arf3DS4 package can read and write fMRI data in Nifti format ( list(list(""fmri.data"")) ). It is build to be compatible with fMRI analysis packages (e.g. FSL or SPM).

astrodatR,GX,GX 5-1: X-ray source variability,"This dataset is a time series of the rapid changes in brightness seen in the Galactic X-ray binary star GX 5-1 lying near the Galactic Center.  X-ray binaries produce prodigious high energy radiation as gas from a companion star is accreted onto a compact companion (white dwarf, neutron star or black hold); see list(""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_binary"") . While some systems show periodic variations from stellar rotation and orbits, others show stochastic quasi-periodic variations (QPOs) and red noise (1/f-type noise) from the accretion disk around the compact star; see list(""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quasi-periodic_oscillations"") .  Over a thousand studies of the QPO phenomenon have been published. This dataset consists of 65,536 evenly spaced measurements of X-ray counts detected in 1/128 second intervals by the Japanese Ginga satellite (Norris et al. 1990). While the photon counts constitute a Poisson process, the values are sufficiently high (~70 counts/interval) that a Gaussian process assumption is reasonable.  The dataset is described in Appendix C.12 of Feigelson & Babu (2012) and Hertz and Feigelson (1995).  It can be used to study stochastic temporal behaviors in evenly-spaced time series.","A stream of 65,536 2-digit integers that can be read into R using `scan(GX)'","Feigelson and Babu (2012), Hertz & Feigelson (1995), Norris et al.

Bladder1 is the full data set from the study. It contains all three treatment arms and all recurrences for 118 subjects; the maximum observed number of recurrences is 9. Bladder is the data set that appears most commonly in the literature. It uses only the 85 subjects with nonzero follow-up who were assigned to either thiotepa or placebo, and only the first four recurrences for any patient.  The status variable is 1 for recurrence and 0 for everything else (including death for any reason). The data set is laid out in the competing risks format of the paper by Wei, Lin, and Weissfeld. Bladder2 uses the same subset of subjects as bladder, but formated in the (start, stop] or Anderson-Gill style.

BART,xdm20.train,"A real data example for list(""recur.bart"") .","A matrix containing a 20% random sample of the training set for a real data example of recurrent events survival analysis.  There are 100 patients in the cohort: 50 in the training set and 50 in the testing set.  The full data set, list(""xdm.train"") , can be obtained online at list(""http://www.mcw.edu/FileLibrary/Groups/Biostatistics/TechReports/TechReports5175/tr064.tar"") . There are 488 patients in the full cohort: 235 in the training set and 253 in the testing set.  See the Reference below (and the References therein) for more detailed information; a brief synopsis follows. We explored the hospital admissions for a cohort of patients with diabetes cared for by the Froedtert and Medical College of Wisconsin health network.  These patients were identified via their Electronic Health Records (EHR) which include vital signs, diagnoses, procedures, laboratory values, pharmacy orders and billing data.  This human subjects research and de-identified data release was approved by the Medical College of Wisconsin and Froedtert Hospital joint Institutional Review Board.  To maintain patient privacy, roughly one fourth of patients were randomly sampled for inclusion as well as other de-identification procedures. We identified likely incident diabetes mellitus type 2 patients by tabulating their first diagnosis code of primary diabetes (ICD-9 codes 250.x0 and 250.x2) in 2006 or 2007, i.e., no such codes were found for these patients prior to 2006 for as far back as each patient's records go which is variable.  We restricted the population to adults aged 21 to 90 by 01/01/2008.  Among the patients treated in this health system, the vast majority were racially self-identified as either white or black so our inclusion criteria is restricted to these groups.  Since our interest is in patients with primary diabetes, we excluded those patients who were diagnosed with either secondary diabetes or gestational diabetes. For this cohort, we identified every hospital admission between 01/01/2008 and 12/31/2012.  For convenience, follow-up begins on 01/01/2008, rather than from each patient's actual incident diagnosis date which varied over the preceding 2 years.  Following all patients concurrently allows us to temporally adapt, via our model, for seasonal/epidemic hospital admissions such as the H1N1 influenza outbreak in the US from April to June 2009. We investigated the following risk factors: gender, race, age, insurance status (commercial, government or other), diabetes therapy (insulin, metformin and/or sulfonylurea), health care charges, relative value units (RVU), vital signs, laboratory values, comorbidity/complication diagnoses and procedures/surgeries (we will refer to vital signs and laboratory values collectively as signs; and comorbidity/complication diagnoses and procedures/surgeries collectively as conditions).  In total, we considered 85 covariates of which 82 are external factors as described above and three are temporal factors: time, list(list(""t"")) , the counting process, list(list(""N_i(t-)"")) , and the sojourn time, list(list(""v_i(t)"")) Among these potential predictors only gender, race and age are time-independent.  The rest are defined as last value carried forward. For insulin, metformin and sulfonylurea, we only had access to prescription orders (rather than prescription fills) and self-reported current status of prescription therapy during clinic office visits. Since, generally, orders are only required after every three fills, and each fill can be for up to 90 days, we define insulin, metformin and sulfonylurea as binary indicators which are one if there exists an order or current status indication within the prior 270 days; otherwise zero. Health care charges and relative value units (RVU) are measures related to the services and procedures delivered.  However, they are so closely related that recent charges/RVUs are of no practical value in this analysis.  For example, just prior to a patient's hospital admission on a non-emergent basis, they often have a series of diagnostic tests and imaging.  Similarly, for an emergent admission, the patient is often seen in the emergency department just prior to admission where similar services are conducted.  We do not consider these charges/RVUs predictive of an admission because we are interested in identifying preventive opportunities.  Therefore, we investigate charges/RVUs that are the sum total of the following moving windows of days prior to any given date: 31 to 90, 91 to 180, 181 to 300. For many patients, some signs were not available for a given date so they were imputed; similarly, if a sign was not observed within the last 180 days, then it was imputed (except for height which never expires, weight extended to 365 days and body mass index which is a deterministic function of the two).  We utilized the Sequential BART missing imputation method.  However, instead of creating several imputed data sets, we imputed a new sign at each date when it was missing, i.e., in order to properly address uncertainty within one data set, a new value was imputed for each date that it was missing and never carried forward. Conditions are binary indicators which are zero until the date of the first coding and then they are one from then on.  Based on clinical rationale, we identified 26 conditions (23 comorbidities and 3 procedures/surgeries) which are potential risk factors for a hospital admission many of which are possible complications of diabetes; besides clinical merit, these conditions were chosen since they are present in more than just a few subjects so that they may be informative. Similarly, we employed 15 general conditions which are the Charlson diagnoses and 18 general conditions from the RxRisk adult diagnoses which are defined by prescription orders.  Seven conditions are a composite of diagnosis codes and prescription orders.","NA","NA","Sparapani R., Rein L., Tarima S., Jackson T., Meurer J.

bayesMCClust,bayesMCClust-package,Mixtures-of-Experts Markov Chain Clustering and Dirichlet Multinomial Clustering,"%% ~~ A concise (1-5 lines) description of the package ~~ This package provides various Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) samplers for model-based clustering of discrete-valued time series obtained by observing a categorical variable with several states (in a Bayesian approach). These methods are based on finite mixtures of first-order time-homogeneous Markov chain (models) with unknown transition matrices. In the Markov chain clustering approach the individual transition probabilities are fixed to a group-specific transition matrix. In the second approach called Dirichlet multinomial clustering it is assumed that within each group unobserved heterogeneity is still existent and is captured by allowing the individual transition matrices to deviate from the group means by describing this variation for each row through a Dirichlet distribution with unknown hyperparameters. Further, in order to analyze group membership, we provide also an extension to these approaches by formulating a probabilistic model for the latent group indicators within the Bayesian classification rule using a multinomial logit model. In other words, unobserved group membership is modeled as a multinomial logit model which allows for dependence on individual-specific and other characteristics. Additionally, functions to process the results are provided.","NA","NA","%% ~~ Literature or other references for background information ~~ Sylvia Fruehwirth-Schnatter, Christoph Pamminger, Andrea Weber and Rudolf Winter-Ebmer, (2011), ""Labor market entry and earnings dynamics: Bayesian inference using mixtures-of-experts Markov chain clustering"". list(""Journal of Applied Econometrics"") .

BayesVarSel,BayesVarSel-package,"Bayes Factors, Model Choice And Variable Selection In Linear Models","Hypothesis testing, model selection and model averaging are important statistical problems that have in common the explicit consideration of the uncertainty about which is the true model. The formal Bayesian tool to solve such problems is the Bayes factor (Kass and Raftery, 1995) that reports the evidence in the data favoring each of the entertained hypotheses/models and can be easily translated to posterior probabilities. This package has been specifically conceived to calculate Bayes factors in linear models and then to provide a formal Bayesian answer to testing and variable selection problems. From a theoretical side, the emphasis in the package is placed on the prior distributions (a very delicate issue in this context) and BayesVarSel allows using a wide range of them: Jeffreys-Zellner-Siow (Jeffreys, 1961; Zellner and Siow, 1980,1984) Zellner (1986); Fernandez et al. (2001), Liang et al. (2008) and Bayarri et al. (2012). The interaction with the package is through a friendly interface that syntactically mimics the well-known lm command of R. The resulting objects can be easily explored providing the user very valuable information (like marginal, joint and conditional inclusion probabilities of potential variables; the highest posterior probability model, HPM; the median probability model, MPM) about the structure of the true -data generating- model. Additionally, BayesVarSel incorporates abilities to handle problems with a large number of potential explanatory variables through parallel and heuristic versions (Garcia-Donato and Martinez-Beneito 2013) of the main commands.","NA","NA","Bayarri, M.J., Berger, J.O., Forte, A. and Garcia-Donato, G.

This is a continuous-time stochastic model of movement in which the probability of being in an area during the time of observation is conditioned on starting and ending locations. A BBMM is typically fit to animal location data obtained by a Global Positioning System (GPS) or Very High Frequency (VHF) device. The model provides an empirical estimate of the movement path of an animal using discrete location data obtained at relatively short time intervals.

Data represent an extensive capture-recapture experiment at the Masoala rainforest exhibit, Zurich Zoo. The researchers used the individual color patterns of this gecko species for photo recognition. Due to the high number of sampling sessions, this study is based on an unusually good dataset. Moreover, it is a captive population and, therefore, we can be sure that the closed population assumption is valid. However, the dataset is comparable to natural conditions because of the dimensions of the Masoala rainforest exhibit; it is currently the second largest tropical exhibit in the world. Additional variation in the dataset results from time-dependent variation in recapture rates (obvious dependence of gecko activity on daily weather) and the photographic capture method (it is harder to spot and photograph juvenile compared to adult geckos).",A matrix with 68 rows (observed units) and 30 columns (capture occasions),"NA","Wanger T.C. et al.

Until this rediscovery, the habitat and host plants were unknown for western Oregon populations, and the great copper was conspicuously sparse in collections, with a total of twelve specimens captured between 1896 and 1970.

bc3net,bc3net-package,BC3NET Gene Regulatory network Inference,"The basic idea of BC3NET is to generate from one dataset D_s, consisting of s samples, an ensemble of B independent bootstrap datasets D_k by sampling from D(s) with replacement by using a non-parametric bootstrap (Efron 1993). Then, for each generated data set D_k in the ensemble, a network G^b_k is inferred by using C3NET (Altay 2010a). From the ensemble of networks G^b_k we construct one weighted network G^b_w which is used to determine the statistical significance of the connection between gene pairs. This results in the final binary, undirected network G. A base component of BC3NET is the inference method C3NET introduced in Altay (2010a), which we present in the following in a modified form to obtain a more efficient implementation. Briefly, C3NET consists of three main steps. First, mutual information values among all gene pairs are estimated. Second, an extremal selection strategy is applied allowing each of the p genes in a given dataset to contribute at most one edge to the inferred network. That means we need to test only p different hypotheses and not p(p-1)/2. This potential edge corresponds to the hypothesis test that needs to be conducted for each of the p genes. Third, a multiple testing procedure is applied to control the type one error. In the above described context, this results in a network G^b_k.","NA","NA","de Matos Simoes R, Emmert-Streib F., Bagging statistical network inference from large-scale gene expression data., PLoS One. 2012;7(3):e33624.

Benchmarking,Benchmarking-package,Data Envelopment Analyses (DEA) and Stochastic Frontier Analyses (SFA) -- Model Estimations and Efficiency Measuring,"The Benchmarking package contains methods to estimate technologies and measure efficiencies using DEA and SFA. Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) are supported under different technology assumptions (fdh, vrs, drs, crs, irs, add), and using different efficiency measures (input based, output based, hyperbolic graph, additive, super, directional). Peers are available, partial price information can be included, and optimal cost, revenue and profit can be calculated. Evaluation of mergers are also supported. A comparative method for estimating stochastic frontier function (SFA) efficiencies is included. The methods can solve not only standard models, but also many other model variants, and they can be modified to solve new models. The package also support simple plots of DEA technologies with two goods; either as a transformation curve (2 outputs), an isoquant (2 inputs), or a production function (1 input and 1 output). When more inputs and outputs are available they are aggregated using weights (prices, relative prices). The package complements the book, Bogetoft and Otto, list(""Benchmarking with DEA, SFA, and R"") , Springer-Verlag 2011, but can of course also be used as a stand-alone package.","NA","NA","Bogetoft and Otto; list(""Benchmarking with DEA, SFA, and R"") ; Springer 2011 Paul W.

bifactorial,bifactorial,General information on the package,"Factorial clinical trial designs can be used to test for the efficacy of combination drugs with two or more components, where inference on the question if a combination therapy is more efficacious than both of its components is based on the min-test proposed by Laska and Meisner (1989). This is due to regulatoric demands requiring a contribution of all compounds in a combination drug. The AVE- and MAX-approaches proposed by Hung, Chi and Lipicky (1993) test for the existence of any desirable combination. Bootstrap-based methods are implemented as well as classical approaches available from literature to obtain p-values and confidence intervals in such designs. For the min-test, analytical methods use a normality and homoscedasticity assumption on the data (Hung, Chi and Lipicky, 1993 and Hung, 2000). Critical values needed for determination of confidence intervals are calculated using quantiles of the multivariate t-distribution (Bretz, Genz and Hothorn 2001). These methods fail when handling with data that are skewed or heteroscedastic over the treatment groups. Furthermore, no analytical approach is available for the trifactorial case and the AVE- and MAX-tests on binary data. In the bootstrap approach, only the empirical distribution of the data is used and thus the results are valid for any distributional shape, provided that sufficiently large samples are available. Less analytical framework is needed to handle with the distributional properties of the tests. Further information on resampling-based methods and theoretical backgrounds are given in Westfall and Young (1993). Anyway, the problem of the extremely decreasing power for small values of the so-called nuisance parameters indicating the response differences between the marginal treatment groups cannot be resolved by the bootstrap approach. Any algorithm based on estimates for the nuisance parameters other than the assumption that they are infinite will exceed the given significance level (Snapinn, 1987). The package contains the generic functions list(""mintest"") and list(""margint"") to test for mean differences of given numeric data vectors and differences in event rates for binary data applications. Method dispatch is available for objects of class list(""carpet"") or list(""cube"") , which will lead to min-test results on a bi- or trifactorial design and corresponding confidence intervals comparing combination treatments with their respective component therapies. Implementations for global tests are also available by the generic functions list(""avetest"") list(""maxtest"") .","NA","NA","Bretz F, Genz A, Hothorn LA (2001): On the numerical availability of multiple comparison procedures.

bigGP,krigeProblem-class,"Class list(""\""krigeProblem\"""")","The list(""krigeProblem"") class provides functionality for kriging using distributed calculations, based on maximum likelihood estimation. The class includes methods for standard kriging calculations and metadata necessary for carrying out the methods in a distributed fashion. To carry out kriging calculations, one must first initialize an object of the class. This is done using list(""krigeProblem$new"") and help on initialization can be obtained via list(""krigeProblem$help('initialize')"") (but noting that the call is not list(""krigeProblem$initialize"") ). Note that in what follows I refer to observation and prediction 'locations'. This is natural for spatial problems, but for non-spatial problems, 'locations' is meant to refer to the points within the relevant domain at which observations are available and predictions wish to be made. The user must provide functions that create the subsets of the mean vector(s) and the covariance matrix/matrices. Functions for the mean vector and covariance matrix for observation locations are required, while those for the mean vector for prediction locations, the cross-covariance matrix (where the first column is the index of the observation locations and the second of the prediction locations), and the prediction covariance matrix for prediction locations are required when doing prediction and posterior simulation. These functions should follow the form of list(""SN2011fe_meanfunc"") , list(""SN2011fe_predmeanfunc"") list(""SN2011fe_covfunc"") list(""SN2011fe_predcovfunc"") , and list(""SN2011fe_crosscovfunc"") . Namely, they should take three arguments, the first a vector of all the parameters for the Gaussian process (both mean and covariance), the second an arbitrary list of inputs (in general this would include the observation and prediction locations), and the third being indices, which will be provided by the package and will differ between slave processes. For the mean functions, the indices will be a vector, indicating which of the vector elements are stored on a given process. For the covariance functions, the indices will be a two column matrix, with each row a pair of indices (row, column), indicating the elements of the matrix stored on a given process. Thus, the user-provided functions should use the second and third arguments to construct the elements of the vectors/matrices belonging on the slave process. Note that the elements of the matrices are stored as vectors (vectorizing matrices column-wise, as natural for column-major matrices). Users can simply have their functions operate on the rows of the index matrix without worrying about ordering. An optional fourth argument contains cached values that need not be computed at every call to the user-provided function. If the user wants to make use of caching of values to avoid expensive recomputation, the user function should mimic . That is, when the user wishes to change the cached values (including on first use of the function), the function should return a two-element list, with the first element being the covariance matrix elements and the second containing whatever object is to be cached. This cached object will be provided to the function on subsequent calls as the fourth argument. Note that one should have all necessary packages required for calculation of the mean vector(s) and covariance matrix/matrices installed on all machines used and the names of these packages should be passed as the list(""packages"") argument to the initialization. Help for the various methods of the class can be obtained with list(""krigeProblem$help('methodName')"") and a list of fields and methods in the class with list(""krigeProblem$help()"") . In general, list(""n"") (or list(""n1"") and list(""n2"") ) refer to the length or number of rows/columns of vectors and matrices and list(""h"") list(""h1"") list(""h2"") ) to the block replication factor for these vectors and matrices. More details on block replication factors can be found in the references in list(""references"") ; these are set at reasonable values automatically, and for simplicity, one can set them at one, in which case the number of blocks into which the primary covariance matrix is split is list(list(""P"")) , the number of slave processes. Cross-covariance matrices returned to the user will have number of rows equal to the number of observation locations and number of columns to the number of prediction locations. Matrices of realizations will have each realized field as a single column.","NA","NA","Paciorek, C.J., B. Lipshitz, W. Zhuo, Prabhat, C.G. Kaufman, and R.C.  Thomas. 2015.

It gives possibility to shrink any subset of parameters in the model. It has special computational advantage for the cases when the number of shrinkage parameters exceeds the number of observations. For example, the package is very useful for fitting large-scale omics data, such as high-throughput genotype data (genomics), gene expression data (transcriptomics), metabolomics data, etc.","NA","NA","Shen X, Alam M, Fikse F and Ronnegard L (2013). list(""A novel generalized ridge regression method for quantitative genetics"") . list(""Genetics"") , list(""193"") , 1255-1268.",FALSE,FALSE

We provide both a non-parametric method, termed the bounded midpoint estimator (BME), which assigns cases to their bin midpoints; except for the censored bins, where cases are assigned to an income estimated by fitting a Pareto distribution. Because the usual Pareto estimate can be inaccurate or undefined, especially in small samples, we implement a bounded Pareto estimate that yields much better results.  We also provide a parametric approach, which fits distributions from the generalized beta (GB) family. Because some GB distributions can have poor fit or undefined estimates, we fit 10 GB-family distributions and use multimodel inference to obtain definite estimates from the best-fitting distributions. We also provide binned income data from all United States of America school districts, counties, and states.","NA","NA",FIXME - references,TRUE,TRUE

It involves methods for estimating a proportion in a single population (assuming sensitivity and specificity 1 in designs with equal group sizes), as well as hypothesis tests and functions for experimental design for this situation. For estimating one proportion or the difference of proportions, a number of confidence interval methods are included, which can deal with various different pool sizes.

biogas,biogas-package,Process Biogas Data and Predict Biogas Production,"Functions for working with biogas data. Both low- and high-level functions are included for carrying out common tasks for processing and analysis of biogas and related data. Molar mass and calculated oxygen demand (COD') can be determined from a chemical formula. Measured gas volume can be corrected for water vapor and to (possibly user-defined) standard temperature and pressure. Gas composition, cumulative production, or other variables can be interpolated to a specified time. Cumulative biogas and methane production (and rates) can be calculated from individual biogas volume (or reactor mass) and biogas composition measurements for any number of reactors. With cumulative methane production data and data on reactor contents, biochemical methane potential (BMP) can be calculated and summarised, including subtraction of the inoculum contribution and normalisation by substrate mass. Cumulative production and production rates can be summarised in several different ways (e.g., omitting normalisation) using the same function. Lastly, biogas and methane production can be predicted from substrate composition and additional, optional data.","NA","NA","Hafner, S.D., Rennuit, C., Triolo, J.M., Richards, B.K. 2015.

Biograph,Biograph-package,"Explore life histories (biographies, lifepaths)","Biograph is designed to facilitate the descriptive and statistical analysis of life histories. It follows a multistate perspective on the life course and conceptualizes the life course as a sequence of states and transitions between states (events). Transitions are governed by transition rates that depend on event counts and exposure times. Transition rates also depend on covariates. Biograph produces useful life-course indicators for individuals and groups: (1) types of episodes (open, closed) and transitions (transient, absorbing), (2) states occupied at various ages, (3) sojourn times in different states and (4) state sequences (trajectories). Biograph estimates transition rates by age, origin and destination. Biograph also structures the data for multistate statistical and demographic modeling of life histories. Biograph accepts data in wide format. The user needs to create a Biograph object from original data. The object has a fixed data structure and is input to most functions. The Doc subdirectory of the package (inst/doc of the source package) contains a description of how to prepare Biograph objects. It includes illustrations and R code. It demonstrates the preparation of Biograph objects using hypothetical data and data from the German Life History Survey (GLHS) (used by Blossfeld and Rohwer in their book Techniques of Event History Modeling, 2002), the Netherlands Family and Fertility Survey (NLOG98), the Survey on Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE), the National Family Life Survey of India (NFHS) and data from the European Registry for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) (included in the mstate package developed by Putter and colleagues).

The species interaction matrix describes the number of bee visits to 138 individual plants in natural clumps of 13 Malpighiaceae species during the flowering peak of each species. The number of bee visits  to flowers was registered over four consecutive days, from 5.00 to 17.00 with a total of 1392 h of observations. Location: Parque Nacional do Catimbau, Brazil (8°24'00'' - 37° 36'35''S and 3° 09'30'' - 37° 14'40''W) Biome: Caatinga (Brazilian steppe) The paper itself contrasted a network of Malpighiaceae oil-flowers and associated oil-collecting bees from a Brazilian steppe (``caatinga'') to whole pollination networks from all over the world available in the Interaction Web Database. The caatinga network had a perfectly balanced proportion of plants and animals (13 x 13) and was more nested and less modular than all of the 22 whole pollination networks studied.

bit64,bit64-package,A S3 class for vectors of 64bit integers,"Package 'bit64' provides fast serializable S3 atomic 64bit (signed) integers that can be used in vectors, matrices, arrays and data.frames. Methods are available for coercion from and to logicals, integers, doubles, characters and factors as well as many elementwise and summary functions. list() list(""Version 0.8"") With 'integer64' vectors you can store very large integers at the expense of 64 bits, which is by factor 7 better than 'int64' from package 'int64'. Due to the smaller memory footprint, the atomic vector architecture and using only S3 instead of S4 classes, most operations are one to three orders of magnitude faster: Example speedups are 4x for serialization, 250x for adding, 900x for coercion and 2000x for object creation. Also 'integer64' avoids an ongoing (potentially infinite) penalty for garbage collection observed during existence of 'int64' objects (see code in example section). list(""Version 0.9"") Package 'bit64' - which extends R with fast 64-bit integers - now has fast (single-threaded) implementations the most important univariate algorithmic operations (those based on hashing and sorting). We now have methods for 'match', ' %in%', 'duplicated', 'unique', 'table', 'sort', 'order', 'rank', 'quantile', 'median' and 'summary'. Regarding data management we also have novel generics 'unipos' (positions of the unique values), 'tiepos' ( positions of ties), 'keypos' (positions of foreign keys in a sorted dimension table) and derived methods 'as.factor' and 'as.ordered'. This 64- bit functionality is implemented carefully to be not slower than the respective 32-bit operations in Base R and also to avoid outlying waiting times observed with 'order', 'rank' and 'table' (speedup factors 20/16/200 respective). This increases the dataset size with wich we can work truly interactive. The speed is achieved by simple heuristic optimizers in high- level functions choosing the best from multiple low-level algorithms and further taking advantage of a novel caching if activated. In an example R session using a couple of these operations the 64-bit integers performed 22x faster than base 32-bit integers, hash-caching improved this to 24x, sortorder-caching was most efficient with 38x (caching hashing and sorting is not worth it with 32x at duplicated RAM consumption).","NA","NA","NA",TRUE,TRUE

The vertical and horizontal Ordinary Least Square regressions (OLSv, OLSh), the Deming Regression (DR), and the (Correlated)-Bivariate Least Square regressions (BLS and CBLS) can be used with unreplicated or replicated data. The measurement error variances and their ratio (lambda) can be estimated by an unbiased estimator with replicated data. If lambda is unknown and not estimatable, there is no unique solution and all the potential solutions can be calculated from OLSv to OLSh in a (X,Y) plot (extreme solutions), or equivalently from a correlation (between the measurement errors in a Bland-Altman plot) -1 to +1 with the CBLS in a (M,D) plot. The list(list(""BLS"")) and list(list(""CBLS"")) are the two main regressions. They provide a table of the estimates (estimates, standard error, confidence intervals and pvalues for separate and joint hypotheses), the coordinates of the joint confidence interval (confidence region, or ellipse), and the four following hyperbolic intervals: the Confidence Intervals (CI), the Confidence Bands (CB), the Predictive Intervals (PI), and the Generalized predictive Intervals (GI).

Options for the kernels are: two kernels with support in the real line (gaussian and double exponential), two more kernels in the positive line (gamma and lognormal) and one with bounded support (beta). The options for the normalized random measures are members of the class of normalized generalized gamma, which include the Dirichlet process, the normalized inversed gaussian process and the normalized stable process.

Also included is a difference in medians test that applies only to non-censored data and is designed to guarantee coverage for all sample sizes (see list(list(""mdiffmedian.test"")) ).

CaDENCE,CaDENCE-package,Conditional Density Estimation Network Construction and Evaluation (CaDENCE),"A conditional density estimation network (CDEN) is a probabilistic extension of the standard multi-layer perceptron neural network (MLP) (Neuneier et al., 1994). A CDEN model allows users to estimate parameters of a specified probability distribution conditioned upon values of a set of predictors using the MLP architecture. The result is a flexible nonlinear model that can be used to calculate the conditional mean, variance, prediction intervals, etc. based on the specified distribution. Because the CDEN is based on the MLP, nonlinear relationships, including those involving complicated interactions between predictors, can be described by the modelling framework. The CaDENCE (Conditional Density Estimation Network Creation & Evaluation) package provides routines for creating and evaluating CDEN models in the R programming language.","NA","NA","Cannon, A.J., 2012.

CalibrateSSB,CalibrateSSB-package,Weighting and Estimation for Panel Data with Non-Response,CalibrateSSB is an R-package that handles repeated surveys with partially overlapping samples. Initially the samples are weighted by linear calibration using known or estimated population totals. A robust model based covariance matrix for all relevant estimated totals is calculated from the residuals according to the calibration model. Alternatively a design based covariance matrix is calculated in a very similar way. A cluster robust version is also possible. In the case of estimated populations totals the covariance matrix is adjusted by utilizing the theory of Särndal and Lundström (2005). Variances of linear combinations (changes and averages) and ratios are calculated from this covariance matrix. The linear combinations and ratios can involve variables within and/or between sample waves. list(),"NA","NA","Langsrud, Ø (2016): list(""A variance estimation R-package\n"", ""for repeated surveys - useful for estimates of changes in quarterly and annual averages"") , list(""New Challenges for Statistical Software - The Use of R in Official Statistics"") , Bucharest, Romania, 7-8 April. list() Särndal, C.-E. and Lundström, S.

In addition, basic survey statistics are computed. The functions build on one another in a logical sequence.

CARrampsOcl,CARrampsOcl-package,Draws independent samples from joint posterior in Bayesian CAR models,"This package fits Bayesian conditional autoregressive models (also called intrinsic Gaussian Markov random fields or IGMRFs) for spatial and spatiotemporal data on a lattice.  It uses graphical processing units (GPUs) to perform rejection sampling to obtain independent samples from the joint posterior distribution of model parameters, including spatial(temporal) random effects, precision parameters, and regression coefficients for some polynomial trend surfaces. The CARrampsOcl package can handle models with up to three structure matrices to accommodate different patterns and strengths of spatial association in different dimensions.  Such models were used by Besag and Higdon (1999) and by Reich, Hodges, and Carlin (2007) are discussed in detail in Kunsch (1994) and He, Hodges, and Carlin (2007). Rue and Held (2005), Chapter 3, describe (polynomial) intrinsic GMRFs of first, second, and higher orders.  If all of the structure matrices representing association in a model are random walk 1 or 2, then the CARrampsOcl package can estimate the coefficients of the polynomial trend surface, the design matrix of which spans the null space of the Kronecker sum of the structure matrices.","NA","NA","Besag, J.

catnet,catnet-package,catnet: Categorical Bayesian network inference,"list(""catnet"") package provides tools for learning categorical Bayesian networks from data with focus on model selection. A Bayesian network is defined by a graphical structure in form of directed acyclic graph and a probability model given as a set of conditional distributions, one for each node in the network. Considered in the package are only categorical Bayesian networks - networks which nodes represent discrete random variables. The learning functions implemented in are based on exhaustive search and output sets of networks with increasing complexity that fit the data according to MLE-based criteria. The final network selection is left to the user. These selected networks represent the relations between the node-variables in the data optimally. Before starting to use the package, we suggest the user to take a look at some of the main objects used in such as list(""catNetwork"") and list(""catNetworkEvaluate"") and then familiarize with the main search functions list(""cnSearchOrder"") list(""cnSearchSA"") . More details and examples can be found in the manual pages and the vignettes accompanying the package. Since does not have its own plotting abilities, the user needs to setup some external tools in order to visualize networks, or more precisely, objects. provides interface to the list(""Graphviz"") library for visualizing graphs. is not a R-package but a platform independent library that the user have to install in advance on its machine in order to use this option. In order to use , in addition to installing the library, the user has to register a environmental variable with name list(""R_DOTVIEWER"") with the path to the list(""Dot"") executable file of . The routine generates a postscript or list(""pdf"") -file from a text dot-file. Also, the user needs a postscript and -viewer. The full path to it has to be given in another variable with name list(""R_PDFVIEWER"") Note that variable might be already setup. To check this call list(""Sys.getenv(\""R_PDFVIEWER\"")"") in R. The variables and eventually can be registered in the list("".First"") function residing in the list("".Rprofile"") initializing file. Below we give two examples. On UNIX platform the user may use code like this one .First <- function() { ...................... Sys.setenv(R_DOTVIEWER=""/usr/bin/dot"") } On Windows platform the user may have the following two lines in its function Sys.setenv(R_PDFVIEWER=""\""C:/Program Files (x86)/Adobe/Reader 9.0/Reader/AcroRd32\"""") Sys.setenv(R_DOTVIEWER=""\""C:/Program Files (x86)/Graphviz 2.26.3/bin/Dot\"""") Note that all paths in Windows should be embraced by comment marks, ""\"""".","NA","NA","NA",FALSE,FALSE

CCTpack,CCTpack-package,"CCTpack: Consensus Analysis, Model-Based Clustering, and Cultural Consensus Theory Applications","An R package for advanced model-based analyses of questionnaire data. These models can detect the consensus answers of the respondents, and perform a model-based clustering of the respondents. The methods can detect latent subgroups in the data, their differing consensuses, the expertise of each respondent, their response biases, and the difficulty of each question. The ability to parse the variance of the data, by these factors, results in sophisticated analyses of the consensus answers, the clusters, and the respondent knowledge/expertise. These are advanced models that are fit using hierarchical Bayesian inferential methods. Bayesian sampling routines are currently handled with JAGS (please install beforehand: mcmc-jags.sourceforge.net/). The package can currently handle data from questionnaires of binary responses, ordered categorical, or continuous responses. If not already in this format, your data might be appropriately transformed to one of these scales to be fit by these models. The models are based on mathematical publications in the domain of Cultural Consensus Theory (CCT): the General Condorcet Model (GCM), the Latent Truth Rater Model (LTRM), and the Continuous Response Model (CRM). See the relevant literature listed in the reference manual for more information about these CCT models and methods. Respectively, these models are applicable to dichotomous/binary (0,1), ordinal (1, 2, ...), and continuous data. In addition, there is functionality for component analyses/scree plots of the data, automatic plots of the model results, diagnostics for quality of fit, and exporting these plots/results.","NA","NA","Anders, R., Oravecz, Z., & Batchelder, W.

cffdrs,cffdrs-package,Canadian Forest Fire Danger Rating System,"The cffdrs package allows R users to calculate the outputs of the two main components of the Canadian Forest Fire Danger Rating System (CFFDRS; list(""http://cwfis.cfs.nrcan.gc.ca/background/summary/fdr"") ): the Fire Weather Index (FWI) System ( list(""http://cwfis.cfs.nrcan.gc.ca/background/summary/fwi"") ) and the Fire Behaviour Prediction (FBP) System ( list(""http://cwfis.cfs.nrcan.gc.ca/background/summary/fbp"") ). These systems are widely used internationally to assess fire danger (FWI System) and quantify fire behavior (FBP System). The FWI System (Van Wagner 1987) is based on the moisture content and the effect of wind of three classes of forest fuels on fire behavior. It consists of six components: three fuel moisture codes (Fire Fuel Moisture Code, Duff Moisture Code, Drought Code), and three fire behavior indexes representing rate of spread (Initial Spread Index), fuel consumption (Buildup Index), and fire intensity (Fire Weather Index). The FWI System outputs are determined from daily noon weather observations: temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and 24-hour rainfall. The FBP System (Forestry Canada Fire Danger Group 1992; Hirsch 1996) provides a set of primary and secondary measures of fire behavior. The primary outputs consist of estimates of fire spread rate, fuel consumption, fire intensity, and fire description (i.e., surface, intermittent, or crown fire). The secondary outputs, which are not used nearly as often, give estimates of fire area, perimeter, perimeter growth rate, and flank and back fire behavior based on a simple elliptical fire growth model. Unlike the FWI System, which is weather based, the FBP System also requires information on vegetation (hereafter, fuel types) and slope (if any) to calculate its outputs. Sixteen fuel types are included in the FBP System, covering mainly major vegetation types in Canada.","NA","NA","1. Van Wagner, C.E. and T.L. Pickett. 1985.

ChannelAttribution,ChannelAttribution-package,Markov Model for the Online Multi-Channel Attribution Problem,"Advertisers use a variety of online marketing channels to reach consumers and they want to know the degree each channel contributes to their marketing success. It's called the online multi-channel attribution problem. In many cases, advertisers approach this problem through some simple heuristics methods that do not take into account any customer interactions and often tend to underestimate the importance of small channels in marketing contribution. This package provides a function that approaches the attribution problem in a probabilistic way. It uses a k-order Markov representation to identifying structural correlations in the customer journey data. This would allow advertisers to give a more reliable assessment of the marketing contribution of each channel. The approach basically follows the one presented in Eva Anderl, Ingo Becker, Florian v. Wangenheim, Jan H. Schumann (2014). Differently for them, we solved the estimation process using stochastic simulations. In this way it is also possible to take into account conversion values and their variability in the computation of the channel importance. The package also contains a function that estimates three heuristic models (first-touch, last-touch and linear-touch approach) for the same problem.","NA","NA","Davide Altomare, David Loris (2015). list(list(""http://www.slideshare.net/adavide1982/markov-model-for-the-multichannel-attribution-problem""), list(""Markov Model for the Online Multi-Channel Attribution Problem"")) .

For temperate trees and many other plants, spring phases, such as leaf emergence and flowering, have been found to result from the effects of both cool (chilling) conditions and heat. Fruit tree scientists (pomologists) have developed some metrics to quantify chilling and heat. 'chillR' contains functions for processing temperature records into chilling (Chilling Hours, Utah Chill Units and Chill Portions) and heat units (Growing Degree Hours). Regarding chilling metrics, Chill Portions are often considered the most promising, but they are difficult to calculate. This package makes it easy. 'chillR' also contains procedures for conducting a PLS analysis relating phenological dates (e.g. bloom dates) to either mean temperatures or mean chill and heat accumulation rates, based on long-term weather and phenology records.","NA","NA","Applications of some of the methods in the package: Luedeling E, Zhang M, Luedeling V and Girvetz EH, 2009.

ClueR,ClueR-package,CLUster Evaluation R package,"CLUster Evaluation (or ""CLUE"") is an R package for detecting key kinases or pathways from a given time-series phosphoproteomics or gene expression dataset clustered by cmeans or kmeans algorithms. It firstly identifies the optimal number of clusters in the time-servies dataset; Then, it partition the dataset based on the optimal number of clusters determined in the first step; It finally detects kinases or pathways enriched in each cluster from optimally partitioned dataset. The above three steps rely extensively on Fisher's exact test, Fisher's combined statistics, cluster regularisations, and they are performed against a user-specified reference annotation database such phosphoSitePlus in the case of phosphoproteomics data or KEGG in the case of gene expression data. There is a large selection of built-in annotation databases for both phosphoproteomics data and gene expression data but users can supply their own annotation database. CLUE was initially designed for analysing time-course phosphoproteomics dataset using kinase-substrate annotation as reference (e.g. PhosphoSitePlus). It is now extended to identify key pathways from time-series microarray, RNA-seq or proteomics datasets by searching and testing against gene set annotation databases such as KEGG, GO, or Reactome etc. Previously published phosphoproteomics dataset and gene expression dataset are included in the package to demonstrate how to use CLUE package. Type '?runClue' for more details and examples on how to use CLUE. You can also install the latest development version from github with: devtools::install_github(""PengyiYang/ClueR"") Make sure that you have Rtools install in your system for building the package from the source.","NA","NA","Yang P, Zheng X, Jayaswal V, Hu G, Yang JYH, Jothi R (2015) Knowledge-Based Analysis for Detecting Key Signaling Events from Time-Series Phosphoproteomics Data.

cmm,BodySatisfaction,Body satisfaction for seven body parts,"A group of 301 university students (204 women and 97 men) answered questions about their degrees of satisfaction with different parts or aspects of their body by completing the Body Esteem Scale (Franzoi & Shields, 1984; Bekker, Croon, & Vermaas, 2002). This scale consisted of 22 items (not counting the items concerning gender-specific body parts), seven of which will be considered here. These seven items loaded highest on the first unrotated principal component, with loadings higher than .70. Principal component analysis was used to discover whether the separate expressions of satisfaction with the different body aspects can be seen as just an expression of the general underlying satisfaction with the body as a whole or whether more underlying dimensions are needed (for the interested reader: two rotated factors were needed to explain the correlations among all the 22 items, one having to do with the general appearance of the body and the other with the satisfaction with the parts of one's face; the items chosen here all belong to the first factor.)

cna,cna-package,cna: A Package for Causal Modeling with Coincidence Analysis,"The list(""cna"") package implements the method of list(""Coincidence Analysis"") (CNA), which was first introduced in Baumgartner (2009a, 2009b, 2013). CNA is a configurational comparative method related to Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) (Ragin 1987, 2008). Like QCA, CNA processes configurational data, i.e. data consisting of observed cases featuring different factor configurations, it focuses on causal complexity rather than on net effects, it searches for redundancy-free sufficient and necessary conditions of causally modeled outcomes, and it draws on the same regularity theoretic notion of causation as QCA, i.e. the notion e.g. developed by Mackie (1974). Contrary to QCA, however, CNA can treat any number of factors in an analyzed factor set as outcomes, and it does not generate causal models from the top down by first building maximal Boolean dependency structures and then gradually eliminating redundant elements (using Quine-McCluskey optimization; cf. Quine 1959, McCluskey 1965); rather, CNA---as implemented in this package---builds causal models from the bottom up by gradually combining single factors to complex dependency structures until pre-defined cutoffs of model fit are met, such that the resulting models are automatically redundancy-free. As a consequence of these differences, CNA can identify common-cause and causal-chain structures and it can avoid the task of redundancy elimination (which creates various problems for QCA). Moreover, the algorithm does not require an input identifying the endogenous factors; it can infer that from the data. Finally, data fragmentation (limited diversity) does not force CNA to resort to counterfactual additions to the data. While previous versions of the package (cf. e.g. Baumgartner & Thiem 2015) have only been capable of processing dichotomous variables/factors, this package version generalizes CNA for multi-value and continuous variables/factors whose values are interpreted as membership scores in fuzzy sets. Apart from making the whole inferential power of multi-value and fuzzy-set CNA available to end-users, the package also provides valuable functions designed for evaluating the method's correctness and completeness based on data simulations.","NA","NA","Baumgartner, Michael. 2009a. list(""Inferring Causal Complexity."") list(""Sociological Methods & Research"") 38(1):71-101.

coin,coin-package,"General Information on the list(""coin"") Package","The list(""coin"") package provides an implementation of a general framework for conditional inference procedures commonly known as list(""permutation tests"") . The framework was developed by Strasser and Weber (1999) and is based on a multivariate linear statistic and its conditional expectation, covariance and limiting distribution.  These results are utilized to construct tests of independence between two sets of variables. The package does not only provide a flexible implementation of the abstract framework, but also provides a large set of convenience functions implementing well-known as well as lesser-known classical and non-classical test procedures within the framework.  Many of the tests presented in prominent text books, such as Hollander and Wolfe (1999) or Agresti (2002), are immediately available or can be implemented without much effort.  Examples include linear rank statistics for the two- and list(list(""K"")) -sample location and scale problem against ordered and unordered alternatives including post-hoc tests for arbitrary contrasts, tests of independence for contingency tables, two- and -sample tests for censored data, tests of independence between two continuous variables as well as tests of marginal homogeneity and symmetry. Approximations of the exact null distribution via the limiting distribution or conditional Monte Carlo resampling are available for every test procedure, while the exact null distribution is currently available for univariate two-sample problems only. The salient parts of the Strasser-Weber framework are elucidated by Hothorn list(""et al."")

cooccur,cooccur-package,cooccur: Probabilistic Species Co-occurrence Analysis in R,This R package applies the probabilistic model of species co-occurrence (Veech 2013) to a set of species distributed among a set of survey or sampling sites. The algorithm calculates the observed and expected frequencies of co-occurrence between each pair of species. The expected frequency is based on the distribution of each species being random and independent of the other species. The analysis returns the probabilities that a more extreme (either low or high) value of co-occurrence could have been obtained by chance. The package also includes functions for visualizing species co-occurrence results and preparing data for downstream analyses.,"NA","NA","Veech (2013).

copBasic,copBasic-package,"Basic Theoretical Copula, Empirical Copula, and Various Utility Functions","The list(""copBasic"") package is oriented around copula theory and mathematical operations involving copulas and closely follows the standard texts by Nelsen (2006) and from 2015 list(list(""+"")) increasely Joe (2014) as well. Another recommended text is by Salvadori list(""et al."") (2007) and is cited herein, but about half of that excellent book is on univariate applications. The primal objective of is to provide a basic application programming interface (API) to numerous results shown by authoritative texts on copulas. It is hoped in part that the package will help new inductees to copulas in their self study, potential course work, and applied circumstances. The language and vocabulary of copulas is quite formidable as this documentation exemplifies. The author (Asquith) has often emphasized list(""vocabulary"") words in list(""italics"") . Italic typeface is used extensively and usually near the opening of function-by-function documentation to identify vocabulary words, such as list(""survival copula"") (see list(list(""surCOP"")) ). This syntax tries to mimic and accentuate the word usage in Nelsen (2006) and Joe (2014). The package was started well before Joe (2014) so many more citations to Nelsen (2006) are made. The italics then are used to draw connections between concepts. In conjunction with the summary of functions in list(""copBasic-package"") , the extensive cross referencing to functions throughout and expansive indexing of this documentation should be beneficial. The author had no experience with copulas prior to a chance happening upon Nelsen (2006) in list(""c."") 2008. The package is a personal list(""tour de force"") in self study. This package and user's manual hopefully is helpful to others. A few comments on notation are needed. A bold math typeface is used to represent a copula such as list(list(""\\mathbf{\\Pi}"")) list(list(""P"")) ) for the list(""independence copula"") . The syntax list(list(""\\mathcal{R}\\times\\mathcal{R} \\equiv \\mathcal{R}^2"")) denotes the orthogonal domain of two real numbers, and list(list(""[0,1]\\times [0,1]"")) list(list(""\\equiv"")) list(list(""\\mathcal{I}\\times\\mathcal{I} \\equiv \\mathcal{I}^2"")) denotes the orthogonal domain on the unit square of probabilities. Limits of integration list(list(""[0,1]"")) or list(list(""[0,1]^2"")) involving copulas are thus shown as list(list(""\\mathcal{I}"")) and list(list(""\\mathcal{I}^2"")) , respectively. The random variables list(list(""X"")) list(list(""Y"")) respectively denote the horizontal and vertical directions in list(list(""\\mathcal{R}^2"")) . Their probabilistic counterparts are uniformly distributed random variables on , are respectively denoted as list(list(""U"")) list(list(""V"")) , and necessarily also are the respective directions in ( denotes the horizontal, denotes the vertical). Often realizations of these random variables are respectively list(list(""x"")) list(list(""y"")) for list(list(""u"")) list(list(""v"")) . There is an obvious difference between nonexceedance probability list(list(""F"")) and exceedance probability list(list(""1-F"")) . Both are measures in nonexceedance (cumulative probability). Arguments to many functions herein are list(""u"") list(list(""= u"")) list(""v"") list(list(""= v"")) and are almost list(""exclusively nonexceedance"") but there are instances for which the probability arguments are list(list(""= 1 - u = u'"")) list(list(""= 1 - v = v'"")) list() list(""Helpful Navigation of the copBasic Package"") Some helpful pivot points into the package are listed in the following table: list(list(""lclr""), list(""\n"", list(""Name""), "" "", list(), "" "", list(""Symbol""), "" "", list(), "" "", list(""Function""), "" "", list(), "" "", list(""Concept""), "" "", list(), ""\n"", ""Copula  "", list(), "" "", list(list(""\\mathbf{C}(u,v)"")), "" "", list(), "" "", list(list(""COP"")), "" "", list(), "" copula theory"", list(), ""\n"", ""Survival copula "", list(), "" "", list(list(""\\hat\\mathbf{C}(u',v')"")), "" "", list(), "" "", list(list(""surCOP"")), "" "", list(), "" copula theory"", list(), ""\n"", ""Joint survival function "", list(), "" "",

The other measures ( list(""Blomqvist's Beta"") list(""Gini's Gamma"") list(""Hoeffding's Phi"") list(""Schweizer and Wolff's Sigma"") list(""Spearman's Footrule"") ) support sample estimation by specially formed calls to their respective functions: list(list(""blomCOP"")) list(list(""giniCOP"")) list(list(""hoefCOP"")) list(list(""wolfCOP"")) , and list(list(""footCOP"")) . The documentation for Gini's Gamma ( ) shows extensive use of theoretical and sample compuations for all of these functions. list(""Bivariate skewness"") measures are supported in list(list(""joeskewCOP"")) list(list(""nuskewCOP"")) list(list(""nustarCOP"")) ) and list(list(""uvlmoms"")) list(list(""uvskew"")) ). Extensive discussion and example computations of bivariate skewness is provided in the documentation.  Lastly, so-called list(""bivariate L-moments"") list(""bivariate L-comoments"") of a copula are directly computable in list(list(""bilmoms"")) , and this function is the theoretical counterpart to the list(""sample L-comoments"") in the list(""lmomco"") package. Bivariate random simulation by several functions is identified in the previous table. The package explicitly uses only list(""conditional simulation"") also known as the list(""conditional distribution method"") for random variate generation following the guidance of Nelsen (2006, pp. 40--41) (see also list(list(""simCOPmicro"")) list(list(""simCOP"")) list(list(""derCOPinv"")) list(list(""derCOPinv2"")) ).

Two copulas can be combined through a weighted convex combination using list(list(""convex2COP"")) with a single weighting parameter. Copula multiplication of two copulas to form a third is supported by list(list(""prod2COP"")) .

This script demonstrates, using the list(list(""PSP"")) copula, relations between the copula ( list(list(""COP"")) ), survival copula ( ), joint survival function of a copula ( list(list(""surfuncCOP"")) ), co-copula ( list(list(""coCOP"")) ), and dual of a copula function ( ).

In bivariate analysis, there immediately emerge two types of return periods representing list(list(""T_{q;\\,\\mathrm{coop}}"")) list(list(""T_{q;\\,\\mathrm{dual}}"")) conditions between nonexceedances of the two hazard sources (random variables) . It is usual in many applications for to be expressed equivalently as a probability in common for both variables. Incidently, the list(list(""\\mathrm{Pr}[\\,U > u \\mid V > v\\,]"")) list(list(""\\mathrm{Pr}[\\,V > v \\mid U > u\\,]"")) probabilities also are useful for list(""conditional return period"") computations following Salvadori (2007, p. 159--160) but are not further considered here. Also the list(list(""F_K(w)"")) list(""Kendall's Function"") list(""Kendall's Measure"") of a copula) is the core tool for list(""secondary return period"") computations (see list(list(""kfuncCOP"")) Let the copula list(list(""\\mathbf{C}(u,v; \\Theta)"")) for nonexceedances be set for some copula family (formula) by a parameter vector list(list(""\\Theta"")) .

cplm,cplm-package,Tweedie compound Poisson linear models,"The Tweedie compound Poisson distribution is a mixture of a degenerate distribution at the origin and a continuous distribution on the positive real line. It has been applied in a wide range of fields in which continuous data with exact zeros regularly arise. Nevertheless, statistical inference based on full likelihood and Bayesian methods is not available in most statistical software, largely because the distribution has an intractable density function and numerical methods that allow fast and accurate evaluation of the density did not appear until fairly recently. The list(""cplm"") package provides likelihood-based and Bayesian procedures for fitting common Tweedie compound Poisson linear models. In particular, models with hierarchical structures or extra zero inflation can be handled.

Therefore, this is an alternative to the dynamic logit model having the advantage of easily allowing conditional inference in order to eliminate the individual intercepts and then getting consistent estimates of the parameters of main interest (for the covariates and the lagged response). The simplified version of this model does not distinguish, as the original model does, between the last time occasion and the previous occasions. The modified version formulates in a different way the interaction terms and it may be used to test in a easy way state dependence as shown in Bartolucci, Nigro & Pigini (2013).

For example CP7ext, the crack growth and geometry curves have been extrapolated to a larger final crack size. The objects cp4, cp6, cp7, and cp7ext are of analysis type 'single'; i.e., there is a single damage tolerance analysis (DTA) associated with each. cp7ext.Mult.simple and cp7ext.Mult.complex are of the 'multiple' type; i.e., there are two or three DTAs associated, respectively. Finally, cp7.CD is of the continuing damage variety. Any one of these can be used as a starting point for creating a new probabilistic damage tolerance analysis problem, though it is recommended to use the appropriate type (single, multiple, or continuing damage) due to differences regarding the structure of each list.

At each sitting, each judge assessed two glasses of wine from each of the halplots of one of the main plots.  The main plots allocated to the judges at each sitting were determined as follows.  For the allocation of rows, each occasion was subdivided into 3 intervals of 4 consecutive sittings.  During each interval, each judge examined plots from one particular row, these being determined using two 3x3 Latin squares for each occasion, one for judges 1-3 and the other for judges 4-6.  At each sitting judges 1-3 examined wines from one particular column and judges 4-6 examined wines from another column.  The columns were randomized to the 2 sets of judges x 3 intervals x 4 sittings using duplicates of a balanced incomplete block design for v=4 and k=2 that were latinized. This balanced incomplete block design consists of three sets of 2 blocks, each set containing the 4 ""treatments"".  For each interval, a different set of 2 blocks was taken and each block assigned to two sittings, but with the columns within the block placed in reverse order in one sitting compared to the other sitting.  Thus, in each interval, a judge would evaluate a wine from each of the 4 columns. The list(""data.frame"") contains the following factors, in  the order give: Occasion, Judges, Interval, Sittings, Position, Squares, Rows, Columns, Halfplot, Trellis, Method. They are followed by the simulated response variable Score. The scores are ordered so that the factors Occasion, Judges, Interval, Sittings and Position are in standard order; the remaining factors are in randomized order.",A data.frame containing 576 observations of 12 variables.,"NA","Brien, C.J. and Payne, R.W.

The vehicle may be viewed from one of many different angles. The features were extracted from the silhouettes by the HIPS (Hierarchical Image Processing System) extension BINATTS, which extracts a combination of scale independent features utilising both classical moments based measures such as scaled variance, skewness and kurtosis about the major/minor axes and heuristic measures such as hollows, circularity, rectangularity and compactness. Four ""Corgie"" model vehicles were used for the experiment: a double decker bus, Cheverolet van, Saab 9000 and an Opel Manta 400.

Data were obtained in Dr. Carey's laboratory. The main questions are to explore the relationship of age patterns of fecundity to mortality, longevity and lifetime reproduction. A basic finding was that individual mortality is associated with the time-dynamics of the egg-laying trajectory. An approximate parametric model of the egg laying process was developed and used in Muller et al. (2001). Non-parametric approaches which extend principal component analysis for curve data to the situation when covariates are present have been developed and discussed in  Chiou, Muller and Wang (2003) and Chiou et al.

deltaPlotR,verbal,Verbal Aggression Data Set,"The Verbal Aggression data set comes from Vansteelandt (2000) and is made of the responses of 316 subjects (243 women  and 73 men) to a questionnaire of 24 items, about verbal aggression. All items describe a frustrating situation together with a verbal agression response. A correct answer responses is coded as 0 and 1, a value of one meaning that the subject would (want to) respond to the frustrating situation in an aggressive way. In addition, the list(""Trait Anger"") score (Spielberger, 1988) was computed for each subject.","The list(""verbal"") matrix consists of 316 rows (one per subject) and 26 columns. The first 24 columns hold the responses to the dichotomously scored items. The 25th column holds the trait anger score for each subject. The 26th column is vector of the group membership; values 0 and 1 refer to women and men, respectively. Each item name starts with list(""S"") followed by a value between 1 and 4, referring to one of the situations below: list(""S1"") : A bus fails to stop for me. list(""S2"") : I miss a train because a clerk gave me faulty information. list(""S3"") : The grocery store closes just as I am about to enter. list(""S4"") : The operator disconnects me when I had used up my last 10 cents for a call. The second part of the name is either list(""Want"") or list(""Do"") , and indicates whether the subject wanted to respond to the situation or actually did respond. The third part of the name is one of the possible aggressive responses, either list(""Curse"") , list(""Scold"") list(""Shout"") . For example, item list(""S1WantShout"") refers to the sentence: ""a bus fails to stop for me. I want to shout"".

For each estimator populations of randomized offsprings and randomized non related individuals are created from a reference population. By default, all empirical data will be used as a reference; however, functions can be forced to use specific data as reference. Be careful when using several populations or specific references. All populations need to be free of any pronounced population structure. References must contain every allele of the tested populations! Any violation of this may lead to strange results or interruptions during calculations. Based on these reference populations all allele sharing indices and relatedness estimators can be analysed using a logistic regression model. Thresholds for individuals being full-siblings, half-siblings or non-related for each population are calculated. list(list(""\\chi^2"")) statistics are used to calculate whether populations contain more siblings than expected in randomly drawn populations of the same size as the empirical population. Additionally, for different sets of references (full siblings, half siblings and non-related) in comparison to all empirical populations pairwise T-tests are used to calculate whether populations are significantly different in mean relatedness. These results may be biased if the statistical conditions for performing a T-test are not given in the data. You should take care of that before drawing conclusions from these results. Therefore pairwise relatedness for empirical populations as well as randomized populations are passed to the local directory and can be used for downstream analyses. Several plots from each analysis can be exported as .pdf files for visualization of relatedness within populations. For every population geographical locations can be combined with genetic data to find out whether geographic distance has an effect on relatedness. A mantel correlation (Oksanen et al. 2013) plotted via scatterplot including relatedness thresholds from logistic regression are plotted for visualization. Additionally, basic information on datasets can be calculated, for example allele and genotype frequencies, list(list(""F_{is}"")) values within populations or analysis on relative informativity of loci for relatedness analysis. For a quick overview, while omitting statistics, all allele sharing indices and relatedness estimators are calculated for every pairwise combination in one analysis.","NA","NA","Armstrong, W.

Optimization is done with the EM algorithm or optionally with Rdonlp2 when (general linear (in-)equality) constraints on the parameters need to be incorporated.  Models can be fitted on (multiple) sets of observations.  The response densities for each state may be chosen from the GLM family, or a multinomial.

Google style guides were used as naming rules (in absence of convincing alternatives). The 'CamelStyle' was consequently applied to functions borrowed from contributed R packages as well.

dglars,breast,Breast Cancer microarray experiment,"This data set details microarray experiment for 52 breast cancer patients. The binary variable list(""status"") is used to indicate whether or not the patient has died of breast cancer ( list(""status = 0"") = did not die of breast cancer, list(""status = 1"") = died of breast cancer). The other variables contain the amplification or deletion of the considered genes. Rather than measuring gene expression, this experiment aims to measure gene amplification or deletion, which refers to the number of copies of a particular DNA sequence within the genome. The aim of the experiment is to find out the key genomic factors involved in agressive and non-agressive forms of breast cancer. The experiment was conducted by the Dr.\ John Bartlett and Dr.\ Caroline Witton in the Division of Cancer Sciences and Molecular Pathology of the University of Glasgow at the city's Royal Infirmary.","NA","Dr. John Bartlett and Dr. Caroline Witton, Division of Cancer Sciences and Molecular Pathology, University of Glasgow, Glasgow Royal Infirmary.","Augugliaro L., Mineo A.M. and Wit E.C.
