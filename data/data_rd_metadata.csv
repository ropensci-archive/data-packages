Note that geo.sets may even contain nested geo.sets. Note: even a single geographic unit --- one specific tract or county --- must be wrapped up as a geo.set.  Technically, each individual element in the set is known as a ""geo"", but users will rarely (if ever) interact will individual elements such as this; wrapping all groups of geographies --- even groups consisting of just one element --- in geo.sets like this will help make them easier to deal with as the geographies get more complex. geo.set objects may be combined with the simple addition operator ( list(""+"") ).  By default, this will always return ""flat"" geo.sets with all the geographies in a single list.  The combination operator list(""c"") ), on the other hand, will generally return nested hierarchies, embedding sets within sets.  When working with nested sets like this, the ""combine"" flag can be set at each level to aggregate subsets within the structure (although be careful --- if a higher level of set includes ""combine=T"" you'll never actually see the unaggregated subsets deeper down). Using these different techniques, users are able to create whatever sort of new geographies they need --- aggregating some geographies, keeping others distinct (but still bundled as a set for convenience), mixing and matching different levels of Census geography, and so on.","NA","NA",http://eglenn.scripts.mit.edu/citystate/category/code/,TRUE,TRUE

ADDT,ADDT-package,Accelerated Destructive Degradation Testing,"Accelerated destructive degradation tests (ADDT) are often used to collect necessary data for assessing the long-term properties of polymeric materials. Based on the collected data, a thermal index (TI) is estimated. The TI can be useful for material rating and comparisons. This package implements the traditional method based on the least-squares method, the parametric method based on maximum likelihood estimation, and the semiparametric method based on spline methods, and their corresponding methods for estimating TI for polymeric materials. The traditional approach is a two-step approach that is currently used in industrial standards, while the parametric method is widely used in the statistical literature. The semiparametric method is newly developed. The parametric and semiparametric approaches allow one to do statistical inference such as quantifying uncertainties in estimation, hypothesis testing, and predictions. Publicly available datasets are provided for illustrations. More details can be found in Jin et al. (2017).","NA","NA","C. B. King, Y. Xie, Y. Hong, J. H. Van Mullekom, S. P. DeHart, and P. A.

AICcmodavg,AICcmodavg-package,Model Selection and Multimodel Inference Based on (Q)AIC(c),"Description:  This package includes functions to create model selection tables based on Akaike's information criterion (AIC) and the second-order AIC (AICc), as well as their quasi-likelihood counterparts (QAIC, QAICc).  The package also features functions to conduct classic model averaging (multimodel inference) for a given parameter of interest or predicted values, as well as a shrinkage version of model averaging parameter estimates.  Other handy functions enable the computation of relative variable importance, evidence ratios, and confidence sets for the best model.  The present version works with Cox proportional hazards models and conditional logistic regression ( list(""coxph"") and list(""coxme"") classes), linear models ( list(""lm"") class), generalized linear models ( list(""glm"") , list(""vglm"") list(""hurdle"") , and list(""zeroinfl"") classes), linear models fit by generalized least squares ( list(""gls"") class), linear mixed models ( list(""lme"") linear mixed models ( list(""mer"") list(""merMod"") classes), multinomial and ordinal logistic regressions ( list(""multinom"") list(""polr"") list(""clm"") list(""clmm"") classes), robust regression models list(""rlm"") class), beta regression models ( list(""betareg"") class), parametric survival models ( list(""survreg"") class), nonlinear models list(""nls"") list(""gnls"") classes), nonlinear mixed models list(""nlme"") list(""nlmerMod"") classes), univariate models list(""fitdist"") list(""fitdistr"") classes), and certain types of latent variable models ( list(""lavaan"") class).  The package also supports various models of list(""unmarkedFit"") list(""maxLikeFit"") classes estimating demographic parameters after accounting for imperfect detection probabilities.  Some functions also allow the creation of model selection tables for Bayesian models of the list(""bugs"") list(""rjags"") classes.
