Most of us are involved in teaching R in some way, and it is always a struggle to find suitable datasets with which to teach, especially across domain expertise. There are many packages that have data, but finding them and knowing what is in them is a struggle due to inadequate documentation.

Goals:
------

1.  Make it easy to discover suitable data
2.  Write some guidance on documenting data in packages

Deliverables:
-------------

1.  Google Doc which describes best practices for documentation.

Checklist of things to document.

Make sure your documentation answers as many of these questions as possible.

-   What does the data represent?
-   What format is the data in?
-   How big is the dataset?
-   Where does the come from?
-   How has the data been processed?
-   What does the data look like?
-   How do you analyze the data?
-   Where is this data used?
-   Is there a paper, or other external resource discussing this dataset?

1.  A patch for `usethis::use_readme_rmd()` to display datasets in package README files.

2.  A [flexdashboard](https://ropenscilabs.github.io/data-packages) with a searchable table that shows metadata on datasets from many CRAN packages. It has information for over 4000 datasets.

The state of data on CRAN
-------------------------

-   [List CRAN packages with data](R/get-pkgs-with-data-dir.R)

-   [Parsing DESCRIPTION files](R/parse_description.R)

-   [Parsing Rd files](R/get_metacran.R)

-   *Installing and loading packages*

Potential Future Work
---------------------

### Additional Data Sources

-   Crawl Biocondunctor

-   Examine `inst/extdata` folders

### Additional Package Stats

-   Use Github URLs to pull geo-location of package maintainers

### Quality Assessment

-   Scoring the quality of data in a package

-   Creating badges to advertise data quality

-   Contact package authors with data quality deficiencies
